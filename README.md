# Natural-Scene-Recognition
Build deep learning models that can recognize the category of the natural images (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea and street). This dataset contains natural images of size 150x150 for 6 categories (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street). The training set contains 6 folders, around 2300 for each category. The testing set contains 3050 images. The goal is to build a model that can recognize the category of each image in the testing set with high accuracy.
